What is AWS
AWS is a secure cloud services platform offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help business scale and grow

Infrastructure: regions and availability zones

Domain of AWS:
  compute: EC2, elastic cloud compute, clean slate; elastic bin store, EC2 with pre-defined library; lambda
  migration: physical migration, snowball
  security and compliance
  storage: store executable files; s3,
  networking: vpc
  messaging:
  database: cannot store executable
  management tools:
  
Compute:
EC2: raw server, resizable compute capacity in the cloud, which can be customized accordinlgy to your need
Lambda: advanced version of EC2; cannot be used to host an app, can only be used for background tasks; waits for a trigger
Elastic beanstalk: used to host an app, automatic form of EC2; with pre-defined environment (like PHP environent)
Elastic load balancer: distribute the workload on the deployed instances
Autoscaling: scale up and down automatically; whenever CPU usage goes above 70%, automatically start a new server

Storage:
S3: object oriented file system; objects stored in a bucket, a folder in the root is called a bucket
Cloudfront: content delivery network
Elastic block storage: block level storage, provides high IOPS; used together with EC2, one EC2 instance can connect o multiple EBS volumes
Glacier: data archiving service, offer low price storage (magnetic disk)
Snowball: physical transfer of data to aws infrastructure
Storage gateway: provide seamless integration between your on premise servers and the AWS infrastructure

Database:
RDS: relational database management service; automatically done RDS
Aurora: database server; based on MySQL, with 5X faster than mySQL
DynamoDB: management service; non relational database management service (NoSQL?)
ElasticCache: set up, manage and scale a distributed cache-in environment in the cloud
Redshift: fully managed petabyte-scale data warehouse service; analytics

Network:
VPC: virtual network where in you launch your AWS resources
Direct connect: direct connect is a leased line using which you can directly connect to the aws infrastrucure
Route 53:domain name system, url to aws instances

AWS management services:
Cloudwatch: cloud monitoring tool
CloudFormation: templatize the aws; snapshot of the infrastructure
Cloudtrail: logging service for troubleshooting, stored in S3
CLI: command line interface, replacement of GUI
Opsworks: configuration management tools; stack, layers
Trusted advisor: personal assistant on expenditure

security domain:
IAM: identification and authentication management tool
KMS: create and manage encription keys to encrypt your data;public keys and private keys

App services:
SES: bulk email services;
SQS: simple queue service; acts as buffer; list tasks, server reads the tasks from the queue and executes them
SNS: notification service based on triggers;

AWS pricing:
pay as you go; pay less by using more
save when you reserve
